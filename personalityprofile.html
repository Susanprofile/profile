    <p>Base on specific questions conducted the result was surprisingly accurate. Some traits and value that I didn’t know before make a lot of sense now. Personally discovering my strengths & weaknesses, career path, workplace habits, personal life and traits will help to benefit me as I become more aware of it to potentially use it to my advantage. Mediators tense to have creative and imaginative thoughts, and also in tune spiritually. Will work well with other but prefer to operate alone because they are strongly belief in ethics and values that they hold, and tend to be very passionate about advocating or defending their beliefs. While strongly values our own values, but always interested in learning about others and willing to consider many sides of an issue too. Being deeply in touch with values and believes, decision tend to be made with emotion base on what feels right. Emotional decision leads to missing a huge amount of important information as we don’t take them into an account.

    <p>Finding out these different traits about myself is useful, as I become more self aware of the weaknesses to improve when situation ever occur. Many weaknesses of a mediator that may affect while in a team environment is that mediator are quiet of an introverted person. Sharing ideas verbally with the team will be quite difficult, writing will tends to be easier to manage. Decision seems to be made by emotion and intuition, and small details tends to be rejected. Learning to balance others ideas to incorporate to a creative and imaginative minds can help.

    <p>Working in a team environment will be not an issues for me, as the result shown, I tends to handle the situation quite well. Open to listening to ideas while also very passionates about my values and believes keeping in mind that people opinions matters, taking in to an account that ideas are always useful in some ways or another. The number one rules to take while working with many people is communicating to one and another. Forming a well coordinated team will allow work to flow in the right direction. People who are like minded, but also allocate myself with tasks that suits a mediator (me) ways of operating. Personally these traits can become an advantage to a person if we know our self, learning it, understand and adapting to what has been presented.
