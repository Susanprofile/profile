        <p>A little bit about myself I’m sure that I’m not that interesting compared to your best friend but I can assure you that once you get to know me I will at least be considered, right? Well, my full name is Rasamee Phonsonsongkam, I liked to be called Susan and I’m 20 years old. I was born in Thailand raised by a single mother who worked so hard all her life to be able to create me the person that I am today. As you may or may not know but Thailand is known for their food, easy and stress free lifestyle…to an extend of course. Ive spend most of my time studying in Thailand, from year 1 to 6. English is no doubt my second language and I’m still trying to wrap my head around it, which can be very difficult sometime. I’m glade that I have finished my HSC in Sydney Australia but if I’m being honest I didn't do well. No excuses at all but I was juggling football as well as meeting the requirements to pass classes. I was a Boilermaker working on large vessel as well as training full time, this come to surprise for everyone that I've told. I have represented the Australia team from U16 to U18-20 Matildas and played professionally in the W-league teams. I was able to build a life long friendship with the people that I’ve met along the way which I’m very grateful for being in the sport. I like to spend most of my time stretching, going to the beach to do recoveries after training, treating myself to some delicious healthy meals and ofcrures training.</p>
