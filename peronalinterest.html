      <h2>My Interest</h2>
      <p>I always knew that I wanted to do things that involve heavy machineries and its abilities to make jobs that much easier, faster and most importantly replicating with minimal error with advance programming. I didn’t really have any interest in IT before, but I knew ever since I had my first experience using a CNC machine while I was working as an apprentice boilermaker made me understand that technologies is revolutionising in every aspect of all industries.</p>
      <p>It's fascinating the rapid paste technologies have evolved, it all started with a project that I was involved in that sparked it all for me. I was working on a base that goes on the navy ship's deck. The base will be a platform for a machine gun that will be shooting 1000 rounds a second. Engineering drawing was applied for this process, with a different shape to be cut precisely in multiple pieces. I was able to program the CNC which stands for “Computer Numerical Control” using G-code. G-code stands for “Geometric Code”. The code gives different command to the machine like telling it what to do or how to do something eg the speed of travel, the direction of travel and the path.</p>
      <p>Although, there are many Universities in Australia that provides support and valuable resources for student. RMIT stood out for me as it provides workplace skills and challenge student to explore creative ideas, come up with good and service that can better the world. RMIT recognised world wide for “leadership and innovation in technology, design and enterprise.” RMIT provides skills that can be used in work related scenario will help students adapt and transition to work environment. At the time my studies, I hope to have clear understanding of IT and the pathways it can offer.</p>
